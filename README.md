I have used Flame game engine, built on Flutter api for creating this basic clone of a Pokemon type game.
The player can rotate and explore the character anywhere within the constraints of the map using Joystick<br>
Flame is really a powerful flutter package, making it easy and more optimized to develop cross-platform games using Flutter.
